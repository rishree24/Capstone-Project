Streamlit web application using vscode for windows :

**Follow the below steps:**
  
Open your vscode and click the new terminal. Use the Ctrl+Shift+` keyboard shortcut to create a new terminal.
Create a new set up virtual environment. A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects. Run this code : python -m venv private
Activating the virtual environment : private\Scripts\activate
Installation of required packages to the virtual environment.
A. Install Streamlit : pip install streamlit
B. Install Sklearn : pip install scikit-learn
Generate a Requirements File. This file is a checklist for the Python application in question. It lists all libraries and associated versions used in the app. To generate a requirements.txt file, navigate to the terminal and run this code : pip freeze > requirements.txt
Run Streamlit as a Python module : streamlit run app.py
Fianal deploy in streamlit website create account or sign in streamlit.io and deploy final web app.
